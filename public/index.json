[{"content":"A little background\u0026hellip; I bought a digital piano (Roland FP-30x) last year after wanting to get back into paino for a long time. I played a bit of piano when I was young and then played guitar on and off for a few years. I\u0026rsquo;m still playing at a beginner level but getting back into playing as a hobby has been fun. Most of the time I\u0026rsquo;m playing with sheet music or video lessons (I\u0026rsquo;ve been having a good time with Pianote), but also wanted to dig into some more music production and playing with synths / VSTs.\nGetting the audio routing setup right took me a bit of time and playing around with settings, so I thought it might be fun to share. I wanted to get a few things out of this\u0026hellip;\nPlaying the piano just by itself should work without any hassle I should be able to monitor the piano and listen to videos through the same headset/speakers I should be able to set up virtual instrument plugins for DAWs on my computer, play them with the keyboard, and monitor everything through the same headset/speakers The setup None of this was ultimately too complicated but there were a few tricks to get it working just right. Here\u0026rsquo;s a basic diagram of the physical setup below.\np i a n o b l u e t o o t u o h a h s n e m b b a p o d a s r e d t c o s s i m p t p p e a a u a n d t k d e e a r r l s o n e s p e a k e r s The piano sits at 90Â° to my desk, so it was easy enough to run a long USB cable directly into the back of my computer and leave it there. I think it may be more common for people to set this up with a laptop but I like having a permanent setup with my desktop computer.\nOK, so with this setup a few things work out of the box\u0026hellip;\nThe headset and speaker connections are easy enough. In practice I\u0026rsquo;m usually using a headset since I\u0026rsquo;m currently in an apartment, but the onboard speakers are also pretty good. Bluetooth connection on the FP-30x has 2 modes - audio or MIDI. I\u0026rsquo;m almost always connecting with audio to listen to videos or a backing track. Adjusting the volume on the ipad lets me adjust the relative levels to the piano and the piano volume effectively becomes the master Using the piano as a midi controller also works pretty well out of the box, you may need to fiddle a bit with low latency audio drivers. To use the same headset for a DAW or virtual instrument then I just set the audio out channel to the FP30x from the USB connection, thankfully it lets you do both MIDI in and audio out through the same connection\u0026hellip; not sure if that is standard? But this left a few issues to troubleshoot\nWhen using the piano as a midi controller you also get the default piano sound doubled on top of it I missed this setting in the manual but one of the function keys on the FP30-X is built for this. They call it \u0026ldquo;local control\u0026rdquo; but a simple hotkey will disable the onboard sound when playing with a virtual instrument ipad is a little small for sheet music I went luddite mode on this one and bought a printer ðŸ˜…. For loose sheet music I\u0026rsquo;m a bit messy right now but I\u0026rsquo;ll get a system going for that when I need it. I caught a tip from youtube to take some tape and bind loose sheet music like little books which helps keep pieces together. Playing smaller chunks on the iPad is still nice but I like the option to fall back to paper. The default metronome volume is pretty loud on the FP30x Again, there was a trick for this in the manual. Hotkey function on C5 lets you lower the metronome volume. I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to make this persist after turning off the piano though Overall, the setup is working well right now. I play a lot of early mornings or evenings so the headset is nice. Having the setup be fairly permanent also makes it a lot easier to jump in and play a little bit when I find time outside of practice sessions.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/audio-routing/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"a-little-background\"\u003eA little background\u0026hellip;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bought a digital piano (Roland FP-30x) last year after wanting to get back into paino for a long time.
