      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering around with Linux Mint at home for a few weeks now and decided to write a quick update on how it has been going so far. I decided to update my home computer to dual boot into Linux Mint and Win11 after getting annoyed with the Microsoft pushing onedrive and the m365 accounts on bootup. I did still keep the windows partition active as a fallback, particularly for software compatiblity if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fuss with wine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought a digital piano (Roland FP-30x) last year after wanting to get back into paino for a long time. I played a bit of piano when I was young and then played guitar on and off for a few years. I&amp;rsquo;m still playing at a beginner level but getting back into playing as a hobby has been fun. Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;m playing with sheet music or video lessons (I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a good time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pianote.com/&#34;&gt;Pianote&lt;/a&gt;), but also wanted to dig into some more music production and playing with synths / VSTs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
