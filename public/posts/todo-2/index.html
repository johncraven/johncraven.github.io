Current state

New features

Added some basic CSS container and form styling with a little neubrutalism inspiration.
Added more properties on the default todo items; due dates, descriptions, priority
The list view on the homepage includes the description and flags for overdue and high priority items
The detail page now has a basic comment section, making use of the django.contrib.humanize package to format dates into relevant strings like &ldquo;now&rdquo; or &ldquo;an hour ago&rdquo;
And of course, additions to the test suite for new functionality

Process
This time around I am trying to take a more project-oriented approach to learning, and integrating more LLM tools into my workflow. Since I&rsquo;m doing this to learn on my own I&rsquo;m leaning more on the side of using the llm tools to guide me rather than edit code directly.">
