      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-little-background&#34;&gt;A little background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a digital piano (Roland FP-30x) last year after wanting to get back into paino for a long time. I played a bit of piano when I was young and then played guitar on and off for a few years. I&amp;rsquo;m still playing at a beginner level but getting back into playing as a hobby has been fun. Most of the time I&amp;rsquo;m playing with sheet music or video lessons (I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a good time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pianote.com/&#34;&gt;Pianote&lt;/a&gt;), but also wanted to dig into some more music production and playing with synths / VSTs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
